Description:
As part of my statistics coursework, this project utilized Bayesian methods to forecast outcomes for real-world scenarios with significant societal, economic, and geopolitical implications. Our team tackled three complex forecasting questions, employing rigorous statistical analysis and dynamic modeling to derive actionable predictions:
	1.	How far will England advance in the 2024 European Football Championship?
	2.	Will there be a lethal confrontation between the national military forces of Russia and the United States before December 31, 2024?
	3.	Will the Dow Jones Industrial Average finish 2024 higher than 43,000?

Key Highlights:
	•	Bayesian Prior Formation:
	•	Established initial beliefs using historical data and expert opinions.
	•	Applied Bayesian reasoning to update probabilities dynamically as new data emerged.
	•	Clustering of Influential Factors:
	•	England’s football performance: Historical match outcomes, FIFA ratings, and expert betting odds.
	•	Geopolitical tension: Historical alliances, economic sanctions, and NATO relations.
	•	DJIA trends: Macroeconomic indicators, historical performance during election years, and global events.
	•	Modeling and Prediction:
	•	Calculated posterior probabilities by integrating new data from multiple sources, including market indices, expert forecasts, and global events.
	•	Quantified certainty using Sherman Kent’s Chart of Certainty, translating numerical probabilities into actionable insights.
	•	Dynamic Forecasting:
	•	Emphasized iterative updating of predictions to account for unforeseen global events (e.g., geopolitical tensions, economic shocks).

Key Findings:
	•	England had an approximately 20% probability of winning the 2024 European Football Championship, influenced by its FIFA Index and historical performance.
	•	A lethal confrontation between the US and Russia was deemed almost impossible (probability under 7%) due to historical alliances and deterrence mechanisms.
	•	The Dow Jones Industrial Average was predicted to finish 2024 below 43,000, with a range between 39,250 and 40,750, based on macroeconomic trends and historical growth patterns.

Impact:
This project demonstrates the application of advanced statistical techniques in real-world forecasting, providing a robust framework for tackling uncertain and evolving scenarios. The methodology is applicable across domains, from sports analytics to financial markets and geopolitical risk assessment.


Skills and Tools:
	•	Statistical Methods: Bayesian analysis, cluster analysis, probability estimation.
	•	Data Analysis: Applied research methods, posterior probability calculations, and trend analysis.
	•	Visualization: Utilized tools like Excel and Tableau for presenting dynamic probability updates and historical trends.
